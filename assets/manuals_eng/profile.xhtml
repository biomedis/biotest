 <p> You may work with the program, using various profiles for different members of family or conditions for measurement (for example, after daily training at gym). <br/>
To work with profiles, press the button Profiles in the main window of the program!
 </p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/12.png"/></p>

<p>
When you open the chapter of profiles, you will see a list of available profiles and three buttons for operations - lefts, and a list of measures for the chosen profile in descending order of date and time – rights. If no any profile is chosen on the list of profiles, there is just one active button Create profile (1). The buttons  Edit profile (2) and Delete profile (3) become active after choice of a profile. Be attentive: deleting of a profile takes place together with deleting of the whole archive of measures saved in the profile (of course, when you press the button of deleting, a question will appear to conform deleting)! 
 </p>
 <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/13.png"/></p>
 <p>
 After measurement is chosen, the buttons View results of measurement (4), Edit note (5) and Delete measurement (6) will become available.
</p>
<p>
 Presence of note in measurement is shown through   <img src="images/15.png"/>  a sign located lefts from date, and the sign represents a button; pressing on this button, you may view the note. The note is also displayed, while downloading display of measurement’s results through pressing the button 4. 
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/14.png"/></p>
<p>
There is button Dynamics of indexes ups on the panel; this is functional which makes it possible to view dynamics of change in parameters of measurement within certain time. It is useful to utilize different profiles for convenient application of this possibility. For example, you may conduct measurement in the morning, in the evening, and after daily trainings. If you create 3 separate profiles for this purpose, you can monitor time-considering changes of parameters.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/16.png"/></p>
 <p>
 The display Dynamics of indexes contains filter of sampling for dates. For convenient usage: when you press the button Display, a list to choose time period, for which needed to create dynamics of indexes, opens. 
There are ready time periods to be selected; but there is also possibility to choose particular dates (For chosen time period, see below).
<br/>
After filter is applied, two buttons of dates’ diapason will contain dates corresponding to chosen time period; result will be automatically displayed in the same window (the more measurements are in profile and the longer the chosen time period is, the longer time calculation will last).<br/>
If you have decided to choose own time period, you should set the beginning and ending’s dates, pressing the corresponding buttons of dates’ diapason and choose needed dates in the appeared window. You can’t choose unrestricted dates but just those which are between the minimal and maximal ones for presenting measurements in profile (window of profile’s choice limits the possibility automatically). The field of date in window of choice is initialized with average value of time period.
  </p>
   <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/17.png"/></p>
    <p>After choice of beginning’s and ending’s dates, press the button Display and select the item below For chosen time period.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/19.png"/></p>
 <p>Calculation’s result of indexes’ dynamics is shown on several graphs. The list of displayed graphs can be changed through pressing the button Parameters of sampling. Check or uncheck the needed boxes! If graphs are already displayed, the chosen ones will be added, or switched off ones will disappear. The choice in this window is memorized by the program. </p>
