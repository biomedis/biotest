 <p> Pulse sensor produced by the company Biomedis is applied to conduct measurement.<img src="images/sensor.png" style="float:right; padding:5px;"/> </p>


<p >
To conduct measurement, you should assure yourself that needed profile (button 1 of Home screen) is chosen, pulse sensor is connected and registration of data takes place (you see live graph of signal got from sensor to screen).<br/> 
 Then clip pulse sensor to your index finger: the finger’s pad should be placed above the hole of backlight. Place your hand comfortably in order to avoid any motion during measurement! You must not need do any extra motion or speak during measurement.
<strong> Attention! </strong>If you don’t create a profile in case of the first launching, the button Start (Start measuring) will be inactive.

 <p >
The button Start (4) will become active, if only signal’s level is neither too high, nor too weak (note on button will indicate state of signal). If it is needed, correct the level of signal through changing in position of your finger in the clip! Over time, you’ll be capable to place your finger correctly without any problem.  <br/>
  Sensitivity of determination of signal’s level can be changed in settings of program (it is contained in menu ups rights on panel of main window); the setting is called – Lower limit of pulse’s amplitude. If you reduce it, you can start measuring in case of lower level of signal but accuracy may be affected because of false determination of pulse’s peaks. Try to avoid reducing limit without necessity! 
When you are sure that pulse signal is registered normally, and you have made yourself comfortable, press the button Start, when it becomes active! Measurement lasts 5 minutes; time which is left is shown below the pulse graph. 
 <br/> 
You can interrupt measurement at any moment through pressing the button Stop (it appears instead of the button Start after measurement begins). 
When 5 minutes go away, you will see dialogue window of results’ preparing for display on screen. Processing of data will take certain time, depending upon processor’s power of mobile device.

 <p>
When processing is over, you will see results on the main window, all data will be automatically saved in current profile and, there will be titles of date and time. If it is necessary, you can add and edit a note for measurement in the chapter “Profiles”.
