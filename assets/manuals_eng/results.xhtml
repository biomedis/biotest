 <p> You can switch between tabs of measurement’s results through pressing on buttons of menu and also through SWIPE (fast swiping of finger on screen to lefts or rights) on the panel with graphs. <br/> 
Detailed description of principles in methods of measurement and decryption of measurement’s parameters are contained in the chapter Articles. The graphs presented below represent set of test data and don’t belong to a particular person. <br/>
All graphs and diagrams have short description which can be opened through prolonged (over 3 seconds) pressing on the corresponding diagram.<br/>  
Let view tabs in turn.<br/> 
<strong>Tab R-R </strong> displays sequence of pulse period and also average pulse frequency in time of measurement.

<p><strong>Tab Histogram.</strong> <br/>
Histogram of frequency distribution of R-R intervals is classified in diapasons per 50 ms. Histogram is very informative indicator; it is possible even visually to reveal much information about position of regulation’s systems. If histogram has more than one heights, value of tension’s index will not correspond to reality, and presence of such histogram shows that arrhythmia presents.

 <p><strong>Tab Spectrum</strong>. <br/>
Here we can see spectrogram of R-R intervals divided into three diapasons VLF, LF, and HF, and also circle diagrams which show relative distribution of powers of these sub-diapasons. Numerical values of powers’ parameters VLF, LF, and HF and summarized spectrum power TP.

<p><strong>Tab Indexes.</strong> <br/>
It shows such indexes, as <br/>
-	Index of tension - IT;<br/>
-	Index of centralization in rhythm control – IC;<br/>
-	Balance of catabolic and anabolic processes – BAC;<br/>
-	Index of adaptive capacities of the body – IAC. <br/>
Prolonged pressing on columns of indexes opens their description.

<p><strong>Tab Meridians.</strong> <br/>
Here we see 12 meridians of a person in accordance with understanding of traditional Chinese medicine. Description can be seen through prolonged pressing on column of corresponding meridian. Colors display state levels of corresponding organs and systems:<br/>
  -Significant exhaustion &nbsp;<span style="background-color:#0000ff;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <br/>
  -Insignificant exhaustion &nbsp;<span style="background-color:#42aaff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <br/>
  -Norm &nbsp;<span style="background-color:#00ff00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <br/>
  -Insignificant tension &nbsp;<span style="background-color:#ffff00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <br/>
  -Significant tension &nbsp;<span style="background-color:#ff0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <br/>

<p><strong>Tab Evaluation of state.</strong> <br/>
This tab contains short conclusions of all parameters calculated on basis of the measurements. It contains also detailed descriptions of parameters which can be opened through
