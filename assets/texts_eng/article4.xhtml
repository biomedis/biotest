<p>
Application of spectral analysis makes it possible to evaluate quantitatively influence of various regulatory systems on work of heart. Spectrum R-R of cardiointervalogram is calculated, and three sub-diapasons are differentiated.

<p>
HF: 0,4 - 0,15 Hz (2,5 - 7 sec.)<br/>
LF: 0,15 - 0,04 Hz (7 - 25 sec.)<br/>
VLF: 0,04 - 0,015 Hz (25 - 70 sec.)

<strong>HF (High Frequency)</strong> is high frequency, fast waves. Their duration is 2,5-7 seconds, frequency of oscillations is 0,15-0,4Hz. It is usually shown on graph in green color; it reflects influence of parasympathetic system of regulation (processes of inhibition of nervous system’s activity).<br/>
<strong>LF (Low Frequency)</strong>  is low frequency, middle waves. Their duration is 7-25 seconds, frequency of oscillations is 0,04-0,15Hz. It is usually shown on graph in red color; it displays influence of sympathetic system of regulation (processes of activity’s  mobilization).<br/>
<strong>VLF (Very Low Frequency)</strong>  is very low frequency, slow waves. Their duration exceeds 25 seconds, frequency of oscillations is under 0,04Hz. It is usually shown on graph in light-blue color; it displays humoral regulation (slow impacts).
Total power is usually calculated in sub-diapasons; it is displayed in form of circle charts on the image. Diagram HF/LF displays predominance of parasympathetic part’s impact over sympathetic one. Diagram HF/LF/VLF displays distribution of impact’s shares of regulation’s various systems. <br/>
Total power of the whole spectrum (TP) displays general adaptive capacities of the body, reserve of vital powers. If TP is under 1500, it is indicated about exhaustion of vital powers and activity.
 </p>
<p>HF, LF, VLF display values of spectrum’s powers in these diapasons on graph.<br/>
If HF&gt;LF, there is predominance of restoration process of energy potential, relaxation and accumulation of energy.<br/>
If LF&gt;HF, there is predominance of exhaustion process of energy potential, mobilization of body’s systems.<br/>
</p>
<p>It is possible to calculate IC (Index of Centralization  IC = (HF+LF)/VLF) on the basis of these values: 
 it displays the level of predominance of non-respiratory constituents of sinus arrhythmia over respiratory ones. In fact, this is quantitative characteristic of ration between central (VLF) and autonomy (LF and HF) contours of regulation in heart rate.  <br/>
IC&gt;1 , it means that regulation process of physiological functions is characterized through predominance of autonomy (segmentar) impacts in management, reflecting optimal functioning of system (vegetative nervous system). In this case, share of VLF-diapason occupies less than half of area on circle chart (lower circle chart).<br/>
IC&lt;1 , it means that regulation process of physiological functions is characterized through predominance of central impacts in management (humoral system of regulation), reflecting tension of system’s functioning and tendency towards duplication of control over processes. In this case, share of VLF-diapason occupies more than half of area on circle chart (lower circle chart).
