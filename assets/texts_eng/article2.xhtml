<p>After the program has recorded data of pulse through sensor, it differentiates intervals between pulses.  <br/>
Graph of changing in these intervals is cardiointervalogram; it can be seen in the program in the tab R-R. Since measurement lasts 5 minutes, it is possible to see on the diagram how intervals change. Faster changes are connected with influence of vegetative nervous system, while slower and longer changes are linked with humoral system. Using these data, the program calculates all indicators of pulse rate measurement to evaluate the state of regulatory systems.   </p>
