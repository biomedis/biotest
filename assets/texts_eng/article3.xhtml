<p>On the basis of data about R-R intervals, histogram of distribution is built: which intervals and how often they have appeared in the process of measurement; they are usually grouped into diapasons per 50 ms.
Histogram is very informative indicator; it is possible to know out much information about state of regulation systems even just visually.

<p>Mo (mode), amplitude of mode Amo, and variation swing MxDMn are calculated.</p>
<p><strong>Mode </strong> (Мо)  is the most frequent value of cardiointerval in this dynamic row. When it comes to physiologic meaning, it is the most probable level in functioning of cardiovascular system.
 <br/>
<strong>Amplitude of mode </strong> (АМо) is number of cardiointervals, corresponding to values of mode, in the form of percent of sampling’s volume. This indicator reflects stabilizing effect of centralization in management over heart’s rhythm which mainly depends upon activation level of sympathetic part of vegetative nervous system.<br/>
<strong>Variation swing </strong> (MxDMn) reflects variative level of cardiointervals’ values in studied dynamic row. It is calculated as difference between maximal and minimal values of cardiointervals; that’s why in case of arrhythmia or artefacts, errors may occur, if dynamic row of cardiointervals hasn’t been subjected to previous editing. Physiologic meaning of MxDMn is usually connected with activity of parasympathetic part of vegetative nervous system. </p>

Physiologic meaning of MxDMn is usually connected with activity of parasympathetic part of vegetative nervous system. 
Asymmetric diagram occurs in case of transitory processes, deviation in stationary process. The graph with many vertexes indicates about extrasystole and atrial fibrillation. Wide histogram with one vertex testifies about relaxation, moderate variable rhythm. </p> 
<p>Considering parameters of histogram, index of regulatory Baevski system’s tension is calculated  (IN, ИН = АМо /(2 * Mо* MxDMn),it displays level of centralization in management over cardiac rhythm, it means that it indicates which vegetative nervous system predominates: sympathetic or parasympathetic – in fact, tension in work of heart and body’s systems. 
<br/>
High values of this parameter reflect stressful state of body’s systems. The narrower and higher the histogram is, 
the higher the level of index of tension is, and vice-versa: when histogram is wider and lower, index of tension is lower.
 Normally value of index of tension varies from 50 till 150 nominal units. When healthy people experience stress or work physically,
 value of index of tension rises up to 300-500 units, while such values are seen in aged persons with low reserves even during rest. 
 If stenocardia presents, index of tension reaches 600-700 units, while before heart failure, it may reach even 900-1100 units.
