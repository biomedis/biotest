<p>This program is indicated for evaluation of Heart Rate Variability (HRT).</p>
<p>HRT is a good method to evaluate state of person’s regulatory systems. The method is based upon study of pulse frequency intervals in case of sequent measurement of pulse during 5 minutes. </p>

Frequency of heart contractions is permanently changed under impact of regulatory systems in case of changing in internal and external factors which influence on the body. Frequency of heart rate is determined as quantity of heart contractions during one minute, while interval between pulses is time between two heart contractions (R-R interval is usually termed as time duration between peaks of pulse measurement). Frequency of heart contractions is never the same within prolonged time; the body adapts itself to external conditions, reacts to events, thoughts, emotions, changes in work of internal organs; as a result, changes in durations if cardiointervals take place. This fact makes it possible to use analysis of heart rate for evaluation of state of person’s regulatory systems.
