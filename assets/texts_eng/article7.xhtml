    <title>Correlation rythmogram (scatter diagram)</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>The method is following: building of pairs R-R intervals on the planar surface of two-value coordinate system. The first interval (R-Ri) is placed on x-axis, while the next one is placed on y-axis (R-Ri+1); then the process is repeated. Thus, we get a plot of points on the surface (Poincare plot); such graph is called scatter diagram, or correlation rythmogram. </p>

The center of points is located on bisector. Distance between the center of plot and an axis is mathematical expectation of length of interval R-R. The collation of histrogram and scattergram is displayed on the image below.

 <p>If the point is lefts from bisector, the examined heart R-R interval is shorter than the previous one; if the point is rights from bisector, the examined interval is longer than the previous one. If durations of both cycles are the same, the point is on bisector of coordinate axes’ angle.  <br/>
Normal form of scattergram represents an ellipse elongated along bisector. Such localization of ellipse means that certain amount of non-respiratory arrhythmia is added to respiratory one. The shape of circle means that non-respiratory components of arrhythmia miss. Narrow oval corresponds to predominance of non-respiratory components in general rate variability. Length of oval corresponds to LF, while width corresponds to HF of spectrum’s powers. In case of extrasystole, we will see several plots on scattergram: the main one is on bisector, while others are apart from it.
